    "\n",
    "Key aspects of Lasso regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Penalty Term:\n",
    "   - Lasso regularization adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function. The penalty term is \n",

    "\n",
    "2. L1 Norm:\n",
    "   - The penalty term is calculated using the L1 norm of the coefficient vector. This means it is the sum of\n",

    "   - Lasso shrinks the coefficients of some variables, reducing their impact on the model's predictions.\n",
    "     It encourages sparsity in the coefficient vector, keeping only the most important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences from Ridge Regularization:\n",
    "- Ridge regularization (L2 regularization) adds a penalty term based on the square of the coefficients'\n",

    "    is effective at reducing multicollinearity but does not perform feature selection like Lasso.\n",

    "When to Use Lasso Regularization:\n",

    "4. You need a model with feature selection capabilities that can handle sparsity in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Lasso regularization is a valuable tool in linear regression when you want to reduce overfitting, \n",

    "# Ans:\n",
    "Regularized linear models, such as Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net, offer many \n",
    "advantages, but they also have limitations that may make them less suitable in certain situations. \n",
    "Here are some of the limitations of regularized linear models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Feature Selection Limitation:\n",
    "   - Regularized linear models like Lasso are effective at feature selection, but they might not be\n",
    "     the best choice when you believe that all features are relevant. Lasso can eliminate features by\n",
    "    setting their coefficients to zero, potentially discarding information that could be valuable in\n",
    "    your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lack of Interactions and Non-linearity:\n",
    "   - Regularized linear models assume linear relationships between predictors and the target variable.\n",
    "     If your data exhibits complex non-linear relationships or interactions between variables, these \n",
    "    models might not capture the underlying patterns effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Complex Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "   - Regularized models have hyperparameters (e.g., λ for Ridge and Lasso) that need to be tuned.\n",
    "     Finding the right value for these hyperparameters can be challenging, and it often requires\n",
    "    cross-validation. This process can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Scaling Sensitivity:\n",
    "   - Regularized linear models are sensitive to the scaling of features. If the features have different\n",
    "     scales, it can affect the regularization impact on individual predictors. Feature scaling or \n",
    "    normalization is often necessary, adding complexity to the preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Limited Multicollinearity Handling:\n",
    "   - While Ridge Regression is effective at reducing multicollinearity, it doesn't handle it as well\n",
    "     as other techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Factor Analysis. In the presence\n",
    "     of high multicollinearity, different approaches might be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Assumption of Linearity:\n",
    "   - Regularized linear models assume a linear relationship between predictors and the target variable.\n",
    "     If this assumption doesn't hold, other models like decision trees, support vector machines,\n",
    "      or non-linear regression models might be more suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Inflexibility in Some Cases:\n",
    "   - In some situations, you may require more flexibility in your modeling approach, such as when \n",
    "     dealing with time series data or complex interactions. Regularized linear models may not be as\n",
    "      versatile as other model types.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Domain-Specific Knowledge:\n",
    "   - In some domains, you may have valuable domain-specific knowledge that suggests a specific model\n",
    "     or approach is more appropriate than regularized linear models. Domain expertise should guide the\n",
    "     choice of modeling techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Complexity of Interpretation:\n",
    "   - Regularized linear models can make interpretation more challenging, especially when feature \n",
    "     selection leads to a reduced set of predictors. In such cases, the model may not be as \n",
    "     interpretable as a simple linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, regularized linear models are valuable tools in regression analysis, but they are not \n",
    "always the best choice. The choice of modeling technique should depend on the nature of the data, \n",
    "the specific problem, and the goals of the analysis. It's essential to consider the limitations \n",
    "and trade-offs when selecting a regression approach and to explore different models when the \n",
    "assumptions and constraints of regularized linear models do not align with your data or problem."
